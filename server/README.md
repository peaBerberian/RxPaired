# RxPaired-server

This directory is the home of the `RxPaired-server`, the "server" part of the
RxPaired tool.

Its role is to listen and emit on two WebSocket ports:

-   one for communication with the tested device

-   the other for communication to the web inspector, the webpage allowing to
    inspect what's going on on the device.

To be able to match devices to the right web inspectors, a system of "tokens" is
in place. Tokens are strings which identify logs coming from a specific device,
and allow an RxPaired-inspector to subscribe to them by communicating that same
token to the server.

Usually, tokens need first to be declared by web inspectors before a device can
contact the server with it, yet other methods exist to let the device declare
new tokens itself instead. This is all indicated in the web inspector's pages and
by the API documentation below.

## Note about the default server behavior

This server was initially written mostly for short-scale usage, to be exposed to the
internet on a relatively small server and to require as few maintenance as possible.

As such, it will by default generate a password and will shutdown automatically when any
"abnormal" but impactful behavior is detected (all of this is configurable):

1. when more than 50 passwords have been received the last 24h
2. when more than 500 client connections happen in the last 24h
3. when more than 500 device connections happen in the last 24h
4. When more than a million WebSocket messages coming from all devices is received in
   a group of 24h (also, client messages that are too long are ignored)
5. When more than 1000 message coming from all clients is received in a group of 24h.

The server can in any case be restarted and those limitations be disabled at any time.

This was mostly done as a prevention measure from our own mistakes (we could for
example have accidently written an infinite loop blasting logs!) but also as a signal
for when curious traffic is coming from elsewhere.

## How to run it

Before being able to start this server, you first need to install the few node
dependencies it needs and build it:

```sh
npm install
npm run build
```

This server can then be run simply by calling the `./RxPaired-server` executable:

```sh
node ./RxPaired-server
```

It is recommended that you look at this server options first to see if there's things you
want to tweak. You can look at all available options by calling:

```sh
node ./RxPaired-server --help
```

## About HTTPS/WSS

The RxPaired-server uses WebSocket connections relying on HTTP, and not HTTPS.

This may be problematic when testing applications on devices running as an HTTPS page,
as browsers will generally block such "unsecure" requests when coming from a "secure" web
page.

To work-around this issue, it is for now recommended to set up an HTTPS proxy, which
will redirect to the right RxPaired port(s).
This can be done by using server softwares like [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/)
or [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) on servers with a valid certificate, **OR**, if you
don't have such server at hand, solutions like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).

Note that technically, if you prefer to only proxify one WebSocket connection between
the two listened to, the one listening for devices is usually the most important one.
This is because the other one will be linked to the `RxPaired-inspector`, which you're
hosting yourself. As such, you may just decide to run it from an HTTP URL which itself
has no issue relyng on another HTTP server.
And even when launching the RxPaired-inspector through HTTPS, it should generally be easy
enough to disable the corresponding "mixed contents" security checks on your personal
browsers.

## How to update it and build it

The RxPaired-server code is written in TypeScript and can be found in the `src`
directory, the main file (the first file being called) being `src/main.ts`.

Before building it, you should install all dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

And you can then call the `build` script to update the code in `./build` (on which
`./RxPaired-server` points to):

```sh
npm run build
```

You can look at the other available npm scripts by peeking inside `package.json`.

## Server API

This server exposes multiple routes by WebSocket to perform various actions.

Note that calling the following routes should already be implemented by the
RxPaired-Inspector and RxPaired-Client implementations. As such you don't need
to read this chapter unless either:

-   You want to update either the RxPaired-Inspector or RxPaired-Client and that
    implies understanding the current API.

-   You want to update the RxPaired-server's code.

-   You want to re-implement any of the bricks of RxPaired, yet not all as them,
    and as such you want to understand its API.

-   You're curious about how it works.

### Through the inspector port

Messages communicated through the inspector port (see server flags) are intended
for exchanges with the RxPaired-inspector web inspector.

If the server is configured with a password, like it is by default, **all** URLs
reached through the inspector port should first begin by the `/<SERVER_PASSWORD>`
path, where `<SERVER_PASSWORD>` is the server's password, then concatenating on
top of it the following paths.

If the server is configured with no password, the following paths should be used
directly.

#### `/!list`

List the active tokens and gives some information about the RxPaired-server.

"Active tokens" are tokens that can currently be used by a device (running
RxPaired-client) and that can be inspected through an RxPaired-inspector (see
corresponding routes).

The server will regularly send (every ~3 seconds) that data back to the
inspector through that WebSocket connection starting immediately when the
request has been performed.

The data sent is an UTF-8-encoded JSON with the following keys:

-   `isNoTokenEnabled` (boolean): If `true`, the `/!notoken` route can be used
    by devices (see devices API) as this feature has been enabled on the server.

-   `tokenList` (Array.Object): Array of objects each having the following
    properties:

    -   `tokenId` (string): The token identifier itself, which can be used on
        the inspector (and which can be used in stored logs) to inspect the
        corresponding logs.

    -   `date` (number): Unix timestamp on the server at the time the token has
        been created.

    -   `isPersistent` (boolean): If `true` this token will only expire once
        its expiration date (see `msUntilExpiration` property) has been
        reached.

        If `false`, the token will expire either when its expiration date has
        been reached **OR** when both no inspector and no device are connected,
        through this RxPaired-server, to that token anymore.

    -   `msUntilExpiration` (number): amount of milliseconds until the token
        expires and becomes thus invalid.
        After that delay, the token has to be either re-created, or a new manual
        expiration has to be set on it through the right API.

#### `/<TOKEN_ID>/<EXPIRATION_TIME_MS>`

Where:

-   `<TOKEN_ID>` is a string composed only of alphanumeric characters.

-   `<EXPIRATION_TIME_MS>` is a time in milliseconds.

    Note that that part is completely optional (description of the semantics
    and syntax of not setting it in the next route's description).
    **Not setting an expiration time is probably what you want to do in most
    cases**. This API is only listed first as it is a more general case.

##### Behavior

If no token currently exists with that `<TOKEN_ID>`, creates a regular
(non-persistent) token which will allow a unique device to send logs to
the server.

Non-persistent tokens will remain available until either (whichever comes first):

-   its expiration time is reached, which is provided by `<EXPIRATION_TIME_MS>`
    (which is the remaining availability time of that token from the point this
    request is received, in milliseconds).

-   all WebSocket connections linked to that token (including this one, the
    device's and maybe other RxPaired-inspectors listening to it) are all
    disconnected from the server.

If you want a token to stay alive until its expiration date, even when no
WebSocket connection linked to it are alive, you may want to create a
"persistent" token instead (see corresponding route).

If a new request is done through that route while a token with that
`<TOKEN_ID>` was already created, the already-created token will keep its
original persistence status but the expiration date will be updated with
the new set `<EXPIRATION_TIME_MS>`.

This WebSocket connection is then kept alive and different kind of messages
(device logs, instruction results etc. see below) will be sent through it.
The inspector may also send information through this WebSocket (see below).

##### Messages sent by the server

Various messages may be sent by the server through that WebSocket connection:

-   **ack**: ack messages are just an UTF-8-encoded `ack` string sent by the
    server as soon as it receives the connection and considers it valid (for
    example: the right password has been set). In cases where the request is
    invalid, the server will close the WebSocket instead.

    It is always the first message sent, and is sent only once.

    There is no response to this message, it is just here to indicate that
    the connection has been well received.

-   **Initial Device Message**: Message sent by the server which describes the
    first log(s) sent by the device. It should be sent before any logs messages
    originating from the device.

    The content of this message is an UTF-8 encoded JSON, with the following
    keys:

    -   `type` (string): Always set to `"Init"`. This allows you to identify
        that this is an `Init` message.

    -   `value` (object): Object with the following keys:

        -   `timestamp` (number): The monotically-increasing timestamp in
            milliseconds choosen by the device when its first message was sent.

            It is intended to be compared with `dateMs` so other messages
            originating from the device may be easily dated.

        -   `dateMs` (number): Unix timestamp in milliseconds generated by the
            device at the same moment that the `timestamp` property was produced.

        -   `history` (Array.string): The last `N` "logs" sent by the device in
            chronological order, with `N` ranging from `0` to the `maxHistorySize`
            value communicated in this same object.

            History is only enabled if you explicitely enabled it through the
            right server flag. In other cases, this array is empty.

            Note that only device messages that are actually passed through to
            inspectors (as opposed to messages only meant for the server) are
            stored in this history (more details below).

        -   `maxHistorySize` (number): The maximum number of elements the
            `history` array (communicated through this same object) can contain.

            If `history` has the same length, then it may be that older logs
            have been removed from it to respect that limit.

-   **Evaluation results**: An inspector can send JavaScript code to be executed
    on the device, those are called "evaluations" by the RxPaired-server.

    When and if a device executes such instructions and if it executes with
    success, it will return the result of executing it in an "Evaluation result"
    message which is described here.

    Note that ALL inspector listening to a given device (through its token),
    even those that did not send the original JavaScript code, will receive the
    corresponding evaluation result if sent by the device.

    Evaluation results messages are UTF-8 encoded JSON with the following
    keys:

    -   `type` (string): Always set to `"eval-result"`. This allows you to
        identify that this is an Evaluation result message.

    -   `value` (object): Object with the following keys:

        -   `id` (string): The same identifier that was sent alongside the
            corresponding original evaluation message sent by the inspector.

            Can be used if multiple evaluation messages were sent to know
            which result is about which evaluation.

        -   `data` (string|undefined): The optional result itself, transformed
            to a string format by the RxPaired-client.

-   **Evaluation errors**: An inspector can send JavaScript code to be executed
    on the device, those are called "evaluations" by the RxPaired-server.

    When and if a device executes such instructions and if the corresponding
    code throws on the device, the RxPaired-client will return the error
    obtained when executing it in an "Evaluation error" message which is
    described here.

    Note that ALL inspector listening to a given device (through its token),
    even those that did not send the original JavaScript code, will receive the
    corresponding evaluation error if sent by the device.

    Evaluation errors messages are UTF-8 encoded JSON with the following
    keys:

    -   `type` (string): Always set to `"eval-error"`. This allows you to
        identify that this is an Evaluation error message.

    -   `value` (object): Object with the following keys:

        -   `id` (string): The same identifier that was sent alongside the
            corresponding original evaluation message sent by the inspector.

            Can be used if multiple evaluation messages were sent to know
            which error is about which evaluation message.

        -   `error` (object): Object with the following keys:

            -   `name` (string | undefined): Optional `name` property on the
                corresponding error JavaScript object thrown.

            -   `message` (string | undefined): Optional `message` property on
                the corresponding error JavaScript object thrown.

-   **ping**: Ping messages are just an UTF-8-encoded `ping` string, which the
    other side of the connection (the inspector) is supposed to respond
    by `pong`.

    The idea behind this message is to ensure that the connection stays open
    even when no message has been received in a long time, as some applications
    (such as servers) might automatically decide to close the connection
    otherwise.

-   **logs**: Other messages that do not correspond to either of the preceding
    conditions are "logs" directly originating from the device, the server just
    passing them through through the inspector(s)'s WebSocket directly as they
    are received.

    They should be encoded as an UTF-8 string with the following format:
    `<TIMESTAMP> [<LOG_NAMESPACE>] <LOG_MESSAGE>`

    Where:

    -   `<TIMESTAMP>` is the monotically-increasing timestamp in milliseconds
        produced by the same method than the "Initial Device Message" sent by
        the device.

    -   `<LOG_NAMESPACE>` is an identifier for the type of log. It is generally
        correlated to the level of the logs (e.g. `error`, `debug` etc.)
        but may also be used to identify another category of log (e.g. `Network`
        for Network-related log).

    -   `<LOG_MESSAGE>` is the logged message itself.

        The message may be truncated (compared to what has been sent by the
        device) if it was originally longer than the maximum length configured
        by the RxPaired-server (see server flags), which is expressed in UTF-16
        code units (JavaScript!).

##### Messages sent TO the server

As a websocket connection, exchanges are bi-directional. An inspector can send
through that route the following types of messages:

-   **pong**: Pong messages are just an UTF-8-encoded `pong` string, which is
    the message an inspector should send after receiving a `ping` message
    through that same connection.

-   **Evaluation**: Those messages allow an inspector to ask the device to
    execute some JavaScript code present in this message.

    After executing the corresponding code, the device will either send an
    "Evaluation result" message if it executed with success or an
    "Evaluation error" message if it threw. Both of those messages are
    communicated by the server and are documented in this API documentation.

    Evaluation messages are UTF-8 encoded JSON with the following keys:

    -   `type` (string): Always set to `"eval"`. This allows the server and
        device to identify that this is an Evaluation message.

    -   `value` (object): Object with the following keys:

        -   `id` (string): Identifier that will be repeated by the device on
            the corresponding result (either an "Evaluation result" if it
            executed with success or an "Evaluation error" if it threw).

        -   `instruction` (string): The JavaScript code to execute on the
            device. Note that the `return` JS keywork can be used to return
            data alongside the corresponding "Evaluation result" message, just
            as if returning that data as the last instruction of a JS function.

#### `/<TOKEN_ID>`

Like for `/<TOKEN_ID>/<EXPIRATION_TIME_MS>`, but:

-   if no token with that name was created, we will rely on the default
    expiration time configured on the server instead (see `-h` server flag).

-   if a token with that name was already created, its original expiration date
    will remain unchanged.

#### `/!persist/<TOKEN_ID>/<EXPIRATION_TIME_MS>`

Where:

-   `<TOKEN_ID>` is a string composed only of alphanumeric characters.

-   `<EXPIRATION_TIME_MS>` is a time in milliseconds.

    Note that that part is completely optional (description of the semantics
    and syntax of not setting it in the next route's description).

##### Behavior

Creates a new "persistent" token - which allows device to send logs to the
server - with the identifier indicated by `<TOKEN_ID>`.

The WebSocket connection will then remain open, and communicate the same
messages than the equivalent `/<TOKEN_ID>/<EXPIRATION_TIME_MS>` route (see its
documentation).

**Non**-persistent tokens are removed as soon as its linked device and all
inspector pages stopped listening to it.
Persistent tokens however are kept alive by the server until their expiration
date is reached, which is provided by `<EXPIRATION_TIME_MS>` (which is the
remaining availability time of that token from the point that request is
received, in milliseconds).

Unlike regular tokens, persistent tokens thus allows the device to send logs to
the server whenever it wants, even when no inspector is listening to that token,
as long as the expiration date is not reached.

This is useful either when needing to debug on another person's device without
needing to synchronize the setup of an RxPaired-inspector page or just to speed
up some quick tests when you don't want to open an RxPaired-inspector.
The flip side however is that any device knowing that token's value may be able
to send logs to the server during the lifetime of this token, whereas
non-persistent tokens offer more security by generally being very ephemeral.

Note that you can update a persistent token's expiration, by re-calling the same
API for the same `<TOKEN_ID>` but with a different `<EXPIRATION_TIME_MS>`, which
will be the new one considered.

To remove a persisted token, you can set its `<EXPIRATION_TIME_MS>` to either
`0` or to a negative value.

If a new request is done through that route while a token with that
`<TOKEN_ID>` was already created, the already-created token will become
persistent if it's wasn't already and the expiration date will be updated with
the new set `<EXPIRATION_TIME_MS>`.

#### `/!persist/<TOKEN_ID>`

Like for `/!persist/<TOKEN_ID>/<EXPIRATION_TIME_MS>`, but:

-   if no token with that name was created, we will rely on the default
    expiration time configured on the server instead (see `-h`server flag).

-   if a token with that name was already created, it will be made persistent if
    it wasn't already but its original expiration date will remain unchanged.

### Through the device port

Messages communicated through the device port (see server flags) are intended
for exchanges with the RxPaired-client running on the device.

Unlike messages communicated through this inspector, those do not need to have
the server's password (if set) prepended to its routes, unless explicitely
specified.

The following subchapters will list the various routes exposed by the
RxPaired-server through the device port.

#### `/<TOKEN_ID>`

Where:

-   `<TOKEN_ID>` is a string composed only of alphanumeric characters.

    That has been previously explicitely created by an RxPaired-inspector
    **AND** that is still considered "active" (see routes exposed by the
    inspector ports for more information on what this implies).

##### Behavior

Allow the device to beginning sending logs linked to that token, so the server
may store them (if the right server flag is set) and communicate it to the
RxPaired-inspectors currently listening to that token.

Note that **only one device at a time** can maintain a connection on that
specific token. If multiple WebSocket connections for the same token are done
at the same time on the device port of the RxPaired-server, the token will be
automatically and directly invalidated and all connections linked to it, both
through the inspector port and through the device ports, will be closed.

##### Messages sent by the server

Messages may be sent by the server through that WebSocket connection:

-   **ack**: ack messages are just an UTF-8-encoded `ack` string sent by the
    server as soon as it receives the connection and considers it valid (for
    example: the wanted token exists). In cases where the request is invalid,
    the server will close the WebSocket instead.

    It is always the first message sent, and is sent only once.

    There is no response to this message, it is just here to indicate that
    the connection has been well received.

-   **ping**: Ping messages are just an UTF-8-encoded `ping` string, which the
    other side of the connection (the RxPaired-client) is supposed to respond
    by `pong`.

    The idea behind this message is to ensure that the connection stays open
    even when no message has been received in a long time, as some applications
    (such as servers) might automatically decide to close the connection
    otherwise.

-   **Evaluation**: Those messages originates from an RxPaired-inspector and
    allows it to execute some JavaScript code present in this message.

    After executing the corresponding code, the device should either send an
    "Evaluation result" message if it executed with success or an
    "Evaluation error" message if it threw. Both of those messages are at
    destinations of RxPaired-inspectors.

    Evaluation messages are UTF-8 encoded JSON with the following keys:

    -   `type` (string): Always set to `"eval"`. This allows you to identify
        that this is an Evaluation message.

    -   `value` (object): Object with the following keys:

        -   `id` (string): Identifier that should be repeated by on the
            corresponding result (either an "Evaluation result" if it
            executed with success or an "Evaluation error" if it threw).

        -   `instruction` (string): The JavaScript code to execute.
            Note that the `return` JS keywork indicates that the returned
            data should be sent alongside the corresponding "Evaluation result"
            message, just as if returning that data as the last instruction of a
            JS function.

##### Messages sent TO the server

-   **Initial Message**: This should be the initial message send by the
    device, describing information on the device.

    The content of this message is an UTF-8 encoded string, with the following
    format:
    `Init v1 <TIMESTAMP> <CURRENT_DATE>`

    Where:

    -   `<TIMESTAMP> is a monotically-increasing timestamp in milliseconds
        choosen by the device when its first message was sent.

        It is intended to be compared with `<CURRENT_DATE>` so other messages
        originating from the device may be easily dated.

    -   <CURRENT_DATE> is a unix timestamp in milliseconds generated by the
        device at the same moment that the `<TIMESTAMP>` property was produced.

-   **pong**: Pong messages are just an UTF-8-encoded `pong` string, which is
    the message an inspector should send after receiving a `ping` message
    through that same connection.

-   **Evaluation results**: When an instruction, through an Evaluation message
    of that same WebSocket connection, executes with success, the device should
    send back a corresponding "Evaluation result" message described here.

    Evaluation results messages should be UTF-8 encoded JSON with the following
    keys:

    -   `type` (string): Always set to `"eval-result"`. This allows the server
        and inspectors to identify that this is an Evaluation result message.

    -   `value` (object): Object with the following keys:

        -   `id` (string): The same identifier that was sent alongside the
            corresponding original Evaluation message.

            Can be used if multiple evaluation messages were sent to know
            which result is about which evaluation.

        -   `data` (string|undefined): The optional result itself, transformed
            to a string format by a method of the RxPaired-client choosing.

-   **Evaluation errors**: When an instruction, through an Evaluation message
    of that same WebSocket connection, throws while executing, the device should
    send back a corresponding "Evaluation error" message described here.

    Evaluation errors messages should be UTF-8 encoded JSON with the following
    keys:

    -   `type` (string): Always set to `"eval-error"`. This allows the server
        and inspectors to identify that this is an Evaluation error message.

    -   `value` (object): Object with the following keys:

        -   `id` (string): The same identifier that was sent alongside the
            corresponding original Evaluation message.

            Can be used if multiple evaluation messages were sent to know
            which error is about which evaluation message.

        -   `error` (object): Object with the following keys:

            -   `name` (string | undefined): Optional `name` property on the
                corresponding error JavaScript object thrown.

            -   `message` (string | undefined): Optional `message` property on
                the corresponding error JavaScript object thrown.

-   **logs**: Other messages that do not correspond to either of the preceding
    conditions are all considered "logs".

    They should be encoded as an UTF-8 string with the following format:
    `<TIMESTAMP> [<LOG_NAMESPACE>] <LOG_MESSAGE>`

    Where:

    -   `<TIMESTAMP>` is the monotically-increasing timestamp in milliseconds
        produced by the same method than the "Initial Message" sent by the
        device.

    -   `<LOG_NAMESPACE>` is an identifier for the type of log. It is generally
        correlated to the level of the logs (e.g. `error`, `debug` etc.)
        but may also be used to identify another category of log (e.g. `Network`
        for Network-related log).

    -   `<LOG_MESSAGE>` is the logged message itself.

        The message should not be longer than the maximum length configured by
        the RxPaired-server (see server flags), which is expressed in UTF-16
        code units (JavaScript!). If the message is actually longer, it will be
        truncated when received by the server and inspectors - which may render
        it unusable.

#### `/!notoken/<SERVER_PASSWORD>`

**OR** just `/!notoken` if there is no password.

Where:

-   `<SERVER_PASSWORD>` is the server's password if configured (see server
    flags).

**NOTE**: This route could have been disabled depending on the flags associated
to the RxPaired-server.

Same behavior and messages than for the `/<TOKEN_ID>` route on the device port
excepted that a token will be automatically generated by the server. This token
will have the default token expiration (see server flags) and be removed based
on the same rules that non-persistent tokens generated through the inspector
port (see corresponding route).

This token wont be communicated to the device, but:

-   If the right flags have been set, it will be present in the name of the
    corresponding log file generated on disk by the server.

-   The `/!list` route, exposed on the inspector port, will list that token,
    allowing RxPaired-inspectors to listen to it.
